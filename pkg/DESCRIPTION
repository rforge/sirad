Description: Sirad package provides functions for calculating daily global solar radiation at horizontal surface using several well-known models (i.e. Angstrom-Prescott, Supit-Van Kappel, Hargreaves, Bristow and Campbell, and Mahmood-Hubbard). The package also includes functions for model calibration based on ground-truth data, as well as a function for model auto-calibration. The FAO Penmann-Monteith equation to calculate evapotranspiration is also included.
